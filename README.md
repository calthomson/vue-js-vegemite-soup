# vue-js-vegemite-soup
This will be a personal blog built using Vue.js, and jump-started with the [vue webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).

### To run the application:
* Install dependencies
`npm install`

* Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
`npm run dev`

* To build for production with minification
`npm run build`

* To build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
`npm run build --report`

### Goal
This is more of a creative project than an engineering project. Keep it simple. The end goal is a fast, responsive, minimalist blog with a streamlined content creation process.

### Stages
* Skateboard: Build index page, post page, and pull post data from simple markdown file.
* Scooter: Add meta data to the markdown file and SSO hooks.
* Motorcycle: Pull blog posts from a decoupled CMS, maybe [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/content-as-a-service/)? Or maybe I can find something even more lightweight. Would be cool to use google docs or boostnote and DIY with CMS.
